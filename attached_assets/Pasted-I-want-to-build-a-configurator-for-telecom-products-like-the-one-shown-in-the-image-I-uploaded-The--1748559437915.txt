I want to build a configurator for telecom products like the one shown in the image I uploaded. The app consists of 2 big parts. Part 1 at the top is where a user can select the tier they would like for each product. Part 2 at the bottom is where we show the total monthly cost, including the calculation of all discounts. On mobile devices (in case the screewidth is smaller than 1024px) Part 1 is vertically stacked on top of Part 2. On desktop devices (screenwidth is wider or equal to 1024px) part 1 and part 2 are horizontally stacked, where part 2 has a fixed positioning and part 1 scrolls.

Please help design the structure and make the app functional, including both front-end and back-end development. Here is some more information on the app, shown in the image:

In part 1 we get an overview of all products: Internet and Mobile.

Each product has its own block which can be turned on and off with a switch pattern. If turned off, we only show the title of the block, if turned on, the content of the block is shown.

The content and functionality of each product block depends on the product. 

For the internet product, these are the elements we need to show:

- tooltip link showing more information about the Internet product, shown right below the product block title
- a tab selector block with the 4 tiers a user can choose from. For each tier we show a title and a subtitle
    - For tier 1: title = “500 Mb”, subtitle = “Basis”
    - For tier 2: Title = “1 Gb”, subtitle = “Snel”
    - For tier 3: Title = “2,5 Gb”, subtitle = “Supersnel”
    - For tier 4: Title = “8,5 Gb”, subtitle = “Gigasnel”
- by default tier 1 is selected
- underneath the tab selector block we show extra information on the selceted the tier: a summary and a price. The price of the selected tier should be added to the total momthly cost which is shown in part 2
- here is an overview of the summary and price for each tier of the internet block:
    - Tier 1:
        - summary: “500 Mbps downloadsnelheid, 50 Mbps uploadsnelheid, Onbeperkt downloadvolume”
        - Price: € 45,00/maand
    - Tier 2:
        - summary: “1 Gbps downloadsnelheid, 100 Mbps uploadsnelheid, Onbeperkt downloadvolume”
        - Price: € 65,00/maand
    - Tier 3:
        - summary: “2,5 Gbps downloadsnelheid, 250 Mbps uploadsnelheid, Onbeperkt downloadvolume”
        - Price: € 75,00/maand
    - Tier 4:
        - summary: “8,5 Gbps downloadsnelheid, 500 Mbps uploadsnelheid, Onbeperkt downloadvolume”
        - Price: € 90,00/maand

For the mobile product, the structure but there are some differences:

- within the mobile product, a user can add multiple simcards (up to 5). By default 1 simcard is shown from the moment the mobile product block is turned on. At the bottom of the mobile product block there is a button to add another simcard. Any simcard that has been added through this button can be deleted as well using the trashcan icon
- For each simcard there is a tab selector block with the 3 tiers a user can choose from. For each tier we show a title and sometimes a subtitle:
    - For tier 1: title = “Kids sim”, subtitle = “5GB Data”
    - For tier 2: Title = “10 GB”, subtitle = “”
    - For tier 3: Title = “Unlimited”, subtitle = “”
- by default tier 2 is selected
- underneath the tab selector block we show extra information on the selceted the tier: a summary and a price. The price of the selected tier should be added to the total momthly cost which is shown in part 2
- here is an overview of the summary and price for each tier for the simcard block:
    - Tier 1:
        - summary: “5 GB mobiele data, 120 belminuten + onbeperkt sms'en, Parental control”
        - Price: € 5,00/maand
    - Tier 2:
        - summary: “10 GB mobiele data, 250 Mbps max downloadsnelheid,Onbeperkt bellen en sms’en”
        - Price: € 11,45/maand
    - Tier 3:
        - summary: “Onbeperkt mobiele data, 1 Gbps max downloadsnelheid, Onbeperkt bellen en sms’en”
        - Price: € 18,95/maand

From a styling perspective, we keep it very simple:

- the dark blue colour mainly used is #2D3648
- the grey colour is #717D96
- the light grey colour, used as background for Part 2 is #CBD2E0
- Teh font-used is Inter
- Default font-size for mobile is 14px, for desktop it is 16px

Make sure that all copy and prices for the tiers are stored in a separate JSON file so I can easily adapt it. Keep in mind that more Product blocks will be added to part 1 in the future.

Please provide the code and instructions to integrate these features.
