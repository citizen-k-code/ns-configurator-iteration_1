For the entertainment block we need to add specific functionality. In attachment you’ll find 4 designs:

- ENT-Close: this is the situation when the Entertainment product is switched off. We show some icons of the services you can fin here, some copy below and a green (#D1FFD9) highlighted block with a title and copy informing on a discount
- ENT-Full: this is the situation when the product is swtiched on and in this image already has 2 services selected
- ENT - non active: this is an overview of the bottom section (see below) with all the services a user can select
- ENT - active: this is an overview of the mid-section in a situation where 2 services have been selected, the 5% discount has been applied and a highlighted blue (#B0DCFF) box informs a user the discount has been applied



In the open card (ENT-Full), we have 3 sections.

Top:

- below the Entertainment title we show a link that will open a bottom sheet overlay with some information. Make sure the content of this bottomsheet can be easily adapted.

Bottom (see “ENT - non active.png” file)

- we show an overview of all services that can be added
- for each service we show an icon, a name and below the price (or starting price) of the service
- it also has a “plus” icon which should help identify each card as clickable
- at the top of this section we have a highlighted item indicating that there is a discount, with some small caption copy below
- The caption should say the price of the service, if there are multiple tiers of the service the caption should say “Vanaf “ and then show the price of the lowest tier
- Whenever a user taps on a service, the service will be added to the mid section and will disappear in the bottom section

Mid (see “ENT - Active.png” file)
