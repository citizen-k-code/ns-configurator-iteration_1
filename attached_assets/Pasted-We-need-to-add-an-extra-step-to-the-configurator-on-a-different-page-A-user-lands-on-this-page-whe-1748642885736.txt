We need to add an extra step to the configurator, on a different page. A user lands on this page when he clicks the CTA. The concept of this 2nd step is very similar to the first screen: a user can activate a product card, for some products he can choose between different tiers. The prices of the selected options are added to the total monthly cost in part 2, according to the same rules.

In attachment you find an image of how this page should look.

One change in the UI of the product cards is that we now show a squared tile as the image of the card. It has a size of 48px x 48px. When the product card is closed, we add an extra line of copy right below the title, informing the user on the price or starting price.

For these entertainment products we need to add a permanent discount rule. IF 2 or more entertainment products have been selected, the user gets a permanent 5% discount on all products.

Make sure the monetary value of inside the subtitle is dynamic, if the permanent discount rule for entertainment applies, the monetary value inside the subtitle needs to be updated as well.

All values should be adaptable inside a JSON.
